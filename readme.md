- Predictive analytics for congestion management
- Traffic signal optimization
- Integration with IoT and smart city infrastructure
- Visualization dashboards for traffic insights
- Historical data analysis and reporting

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Frameworks: Flask/Django (for web interface)
- Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL
- Frontend: React.js/Angular
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Cloud Services: AWS/GCP/Azure (optional)
- IoT Integration: MQTT/Edge Computing
